			I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
		    My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
		    while I also advance myself in business process modeling with Simio.

			My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
		    which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
		    to develop computer-based psychology experiments.
		    This library is a part of my HurPsy project which is housed on GitHub.
		    HurPsy also includes a WPF Windows application which will help
		    non-programmers to design psychology experiments.

			I have recently taken up web application development with Angular
		    and front-end design with Bootstrap.
		    I am also helping my students develop their own projects
			using these platforms and frameworks.
			They will be presenting and explaining their projects
			on their own github profiles.
			In order to inspire them, I have prepared my own Angulartest project.
			For the explanations of its steps (in Turkish), please
